HW5: Thoughts on Output 
Markdown:  2018-10-07_fasta_QC_notes.md

Here are my thoughts on the output I produced. I have listed 3 points that maybe concerning.

1 - Output for ./data/animal_mRNA.fasta looks different than other outputs. In the first few lines, It contains words as well as 
a sequence.   This maybe an error as I  was expecting only a DNA sequence here and no words. In addition, the last 3 lines are
missing.
2- Output for ./data/invertebrates_mRNA.fasta looks unusual.
There first three lines read : This is a file about some animals I think? >NM_012541.3 Rattus norvegicus cytochrome P450, 
family 1, subfamily a, polypeptide 2 (Cyp1a2), mRNA. This maybe an error since I was expecting a sequence here. In addition,
 the last three lines are missing. 

3- Output for./data/plant_rRNA.fasta contains words as well as sequences in the first three lines.  This maybe an error a
 I did not expect any words. I expected only sequences.
